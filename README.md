## Description

This project is an Amazon clone created using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the basic functionality and design of the Amazon website. This repository serves as a learning exercise and a demonstration of front-end development skills.
The layout and elements may not be fully responsive on smaller screens, so for the optimal user experience, it is recommended to open the clone in desktop mode.
