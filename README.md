## Description
This project is an Amazon clone created using HTML and CSS. It aims to replicate the basic functionality and design of the Amazon website. This repository serves as a learning exercise and a demonstration of front-end development skills.
<br>
The layout and elements may not be fully responsive on smaller screens, so for the optimal user experience, it is recommended to open the clone in desktop mode.
